## Introduction
ZKP Sudoku Cryptography is a project that combines the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) with the classic Sudoku puzzle. This project aims to demonstrate how cryptographic techniques can be applied to verify the correctness of a Sudoku solution without revealing the solution itself.

## Features
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify Sudoku solutions without revealing them.
- **Interactive Sudoku Solver**: Solve Sudoku puzzles interactively.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the solution.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **PyCryptodome**: A self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives.
- **Click**: A Python package for creating command-line interfaces.
